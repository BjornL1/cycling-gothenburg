Gothenburg cycling trips is offering bike tours inGothenburg city (Sweden), the background for creating this site is to promote an environmentally friendly and easy way to explore Gothenburg city for tourists or anyone enjoying bicycling. Furthermore, the target group could be anyone newly moved to Gothenburg wishing to make new acquaintances and would suit well for team-activities.

Add an image of the finished site here. I like to use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) to get an image of my site on all device sizes, and amiresponsive allows you to click links on the page and scroll, so each device can show a different element of your site.

Add a link to the live site here, for Milestone 1 this will be the GitHub Pages Link from when you deployed the site.

If you want to add optional [shields.io](https://shields.io) badges to your README, I like to add them to this section.

## Design

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed design section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/earth-day-hackathon-2022#Design)






### Colour Scheme

The landing page is the primary colour contributor to the website, hence the background is white in order the enhance the dominant colours in the hero image which is representing the long nordic summer sunsets.

One of the main colours used in the hero image (#252621) was re-used for the footer as well, the colour is still clearly marks a distinct difference compared to the contact section above it but still keeping the theme consistent with the landing page.



I like to include a palette of the colour scheme here, my favourite site for creating a colour palette is [coolors](https://coolors.co/), 

![colourscheme](colourscheme.png)


### Typography

The fonts chosen for the project is Babas Neue and Kanit with sans-serif as back up, these fonts are distinct but still with a soft edge matching the landing page content. 

These fonts were imported with google fonts [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) 

Kanit: for all content except the header title element (h1)
Babas Neue: for Header (h1)






### Imagery

The imagery is fundamental aspect forthe site, since the service provided is primarly bike tours, various images from the tour were included to let the user being able to properly view the main parts of the route thus improving the experience overall.

Images:
- Landing page and rent a bike section are from pexelbay
- The gothenburg city map is from open street map
- All other pictures are taken by myself



### Wireframes

Add the images or links for your wireframes here.

There are lots of different options to create your wireframes - Code Institute students can access [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) as part of the course.
 Or you can even go old school and get those wireframes completed using pen and paper. Just snap an image of the completed wireframes to add the images to the README.

## Rent a bike

## Contact














### General features on each page

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

## Technologies Used

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Technologies Used section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#Technologies-Used)

### Languages Used

Make a note here of all the languages used in creating your project. For the first project this will most likely just be HTML & CSS.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

## Testing

- Validator Testing
  -  HTML
-   - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C Markup Validator

W3C Validator Results



-  CSS
 - No errors were found when passing through the official W3C CSS Validator
W3C CSS Validator Results

- Accessibility
 - The site achieved a Lighthouse accessibility score of 100%, see below picture from lighthouse testing.



- Form Testing
  - The form has been tested to ensure it would not submit without the required input fields being filled in (full name and email address).
 - It also checks that correct quantity is filled in the rent a bike section of the form.

- Links Testing
 - All navigation links were tested manually to ensure the user is directed to the correct section of the website.

 - Social Media links in the footer of each page were tested manually to ensure they direct the user to the correct page and open in a new tab.

- Browser Testing
The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari browsers with no issues noted.

- Device Testing
The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Laptop, iPhone 11, iPad to ensure responsiveness on various screen sizes. The website performed as intended. The responsive design was also checked using Chrome developer tools across multiple devices with structural integrity holding for the various sizes.


I also used the following website to test responsiveness:
- Responsinator
- Am I responsive

- Solved bugs
  - A problem with the footer was deteced when trying to fixate it in the bottom of the page. At first it was possible to fixate it but then it covered other content above it during. To solve it an instruction on a website had proper advice to on how to solve it by using the "flex-grow" which keeps the footer in the bottom of the page.
